# Basic Math Leaderboard

visit the project here: basic-math-leaderboard.onrender.com

## Core Idea:
Lighthearted leaderboard for bragging rights, incentivises participants to answer questions to rack up points without penalizing mistakes. No need to be perfect, just try! More advanced topics earn more points sothe incentive is to answer lots of questions at just the level you are comfortable at.
Allowing for clan creation additionally allows friends / learners to directly compare scores without worrying about the global leaderboard.

Notes / Future Updates:
- Point scaling needs work if used to push students to try problems outside of their current comfort zone.
- Larger variety of questions
- The minimal UI needs reworking

Known Bugs:
- Buttons are sometimes transparent
- Long server downtime (may take up to 2 mins to boot up)

## Tech:
- React/Vite Node.js Framework
- using Axios HTTP Client
- Written in Typescript
- with Vanilla CSS & HTML
